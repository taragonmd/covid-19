The purpose of this guidance is to support education, public health,
local leadership, and pediatricians collaborating with schools in
creating policies for school re-entry that foster the overall health
of children, adolescents, staff, and communities and are based on
available evidence. Schools are fundamental to child and adolescent
development and well-being and provide our children and adolescents
with academic instruction, social and emotional skills, safety,
reliable nutrition, physical/speech and mental health therapy, and
opportunities for physical activity, among other benefits. Beyond
supporting the educational development of children and adolescents,
schools play a critical role in addressing racial and social
inequity. As such, it is critical to reflect on the differential
impact SARS-CoV-2 and the associated school closures have had on
different races, ethnic and vulnerable populations. These
recommendations are provided acknowledging that our understanding of
the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is changing rapidly.


“Returning to school is important for the healthy development and well-being of children, but we must pursue re-opening in a way that is safe for all students, teachers and staff. Science should drive decision-making on safely reopening schools. Public health agencies must make recommendations based on evidence, not politics. We should leave it to health experts to tell us when the time is best to open up school buildings, and listen to educators and administrators to shape how we do it.

“Local school leaders, public health experts, educators and parents must be at the center of decisions about how and when to reopen schools, taking into account the spread of COVID-19 in their communities and the capacities of school districts to adapt safety protocols to make in-person learning safe and feasible. For instance, schools in areas with high levels of COVID-19 community spread should not be compelled to reopen against the judgment of local experts. A one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate for return to school decisions.
